// gRPC can use protocol buffers as both its Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying
// 'message' interchange format.
// 'message' defines a data structure which is a logical record with key-value pairs.
// This message must be compiled with a protocol buffer compiler, like 'protoc'.
// The compiler will generate a client and a server code for the data access for compiled messages in
// dedicated languages (java, go, etc ...).
// These access are accessors like classes, getters and setters.
// - On the server side, the compilation will implements the methods declared by the service and runs a
//   gRPC server to handle client calls. The gRPC infrastructure decodes incoming requests, executes
//   service methods, and encodes service responses.
// - On the client side, the compilation has a local object known as stub (for some languages, the preferred
//   term is client) that implements the same methods as the service. The client can then just call
//   those methods on the local object, and the methods wrap the parameters for the call in the
//   appropriate protocol buffer message type, send the requests to the server, and return the serverâ€™s
//   protocol buffer responses.

// protocol version, defining the syntax
syntax = "proto3";

// The request message containing the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

// The response message containing the greetings
message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}

// The greeter service definition.
// This is a unary rpc method where the client sends a single request to the server and gets a single
// response back, just like a normal function call
service Greeter {
  // Sends a greeting
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

// This is a Server Streaming rpc method where the client sends a request to the server and gets a
// stream to read a sequence of messages back.
// The client reads from the returned stream until there are no more messages.
// gRPC guarantees message ordering within an individual RPC call.
service GreeterServerStream {
  rpc LotsOfReplies(HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloReply);
}

// This is a Client Streaming rpc method where the client writes a sequence of messages and sends them
// to the server, again using a provided stream.
// Once the client has finished writing the messages, it waits for the server to read them and return
// its response.
// Again gRPC guarantees message ordering within an individual RPC call.
service GreeterClientStream {
  rpc LotsOfGreetings(stream HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

// This is a Bidirectional Streaming rpc method where both sides send a sequence of messages using a
// read-write stream.
// The two streams operate independently, so clients and servers can read and write in whatever order
// they like:
// for example, the server could wait to receive all the client messages before writing its
// responses, or it could alternately read a message then write a message, or some other combination of
// reads and writes. The order of messages in each stream is preserved.
service GreeterBidirectionalStreamn {
  rpc BidiHello(stream HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloReply);
}
